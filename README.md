<h1>Libft: My First Custom C Library</h1>
The Libft project was a significant milestone in my journey as a programmer. It involved building a custom library of functions from scratch, mirroring some of the standard C library functions and creating additional utilities. This project was more than just coding - it was about learning, discipline, and understanding the foundational tools that make C programming so powerful.

<br>
<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
- C Fundamentals Revisited:
Writing these functions from scratch solidified my understanding of pointers, arrays, and memory management. Concepts like pointer arithmetic and the nuances of const qualifiers became second nature through repeated practice.
<br>
<br>
- Dynamic Memory Management:
Using malloc and free responsibly was a challenge. I learned to handle memory allocation failures and to avoid memory leaks—a critical skill in C programming.
<br>
<br>
- Code Organization and Static Functions:
I became adept at breaking complex problems into smaller static helper functions to keep the scope limited and the code modular.
<br>
<br>
- Discipline with Standards:
The project enforced strict adherence to coding standards, including using -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror flags. This taught me the importance of writing clean, warning-free code.
<br>
<br>
- Makefiles and Compilation:
Writing a robust Makefile to compile the library efficiently introduced me to the importance of automation in software development.
<br>
<br>
- Data Structures:
The bonus part of the project introduced me to linked lists, a powerful and flexible data structure. Implementing functions like ft_lstadd_back and ft_lstclear taught me to manage dynamic nodes and pointers effectively.
<br>
<br>
- Debugging and Problem Solving:
Debugging was an essential part of this project. Tools like gdb and valgrind became invaluable allies, helping me track down segmentation faults and memory leaks.
<br>
<br>
- Building a Reusable Toolkit:
By the end of the project, I had a library of functions I could reuse in future projects, which gave me a sense of accomplishment and practical utility.

<h2>Summary</h2>
Without relying on external libraries, I learned to solve problems from the ground up. This project has made me more confident in my ability to understand and build the tools I need for any task. It also taught me the value of perseverance, as debugging and testing each function required patience and determination.
In summary, Libft was a foundational experience that strengthened my programming skills and prepared me for more complex challenges ahead. It was my first step into creating something both functional and personal—a toolkit I will carry with me throughout my coding journey.
